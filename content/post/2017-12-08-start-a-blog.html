<p>I read <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> newsletter almost everyday. Although I enjoy reading other peoples’ blogs and seeing the cool things they do, I hadn’t really considered creating my own until I came across a post by David Robinson: <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog</a>. This inspired me to set up my own blog. The following describes how I set up this site.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<p>All I knew at first was that I wanted create my posts using R Markdown files.</p>
<p>As with most things I don’t know how to do, I went to Google. A quick search for “how to setup an R blog” led me almost immediately to a December 2016 post by Dr. Shirin Glander’s: <a href="https://shiring.github.io/blogging/2016/12/04/diy_your_own_blog">How to set up your own R blog with Github pages and Jekyll Bootstrap</a>. I read through this article and some others on her site. I came across a newer post from September 2017: <a href="https://shiring.github.io/blogdown/2017/09/14/moving-my-blog-to-blogdown">Moving my blog to blogdown</a>. This was my starting point. I was going to use the R blogdown package in combination with Hugo and Netlify.</p>
<p>Like Shirin, I followed the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown ebook</a> to setup my blog. It wasn’t as straight forward as I though and that’s why I chose to make my first post about my setup.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>I read through most of the blogdown ebook before I did anything just to get an idea of the steps I would need to take. I turned back to section 1.1 Installation to get started. I already had R and RStudio installed but I did not yet have the blogdown package so I installed it as well.</p>
<p>In RStudio:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next I installed <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> which is a static site generator.</p>
<pre><code>library(blogdown)
blogdown::install_hugo()</code></pre>
<p>Knowing the version of Hugo installed will be important later. You can check the version via:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::hugo_version()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &#39;0.59.1&#39;</code></pre>
<div id="github" class="section level3">
<h3>Github:</h3>
<p>At this point I created a new repository on Github. In RStudio, I created a new project using Version Control (Git) and filled in the repository URL. I opened GitHub Desktop and added the repository from local path. The last step here was to click Publish.</p>
</div>
<div id="build-the-new-site" class="section level3">
<h3>Build the new site:</h3>
<p>I did all this a couple times actually mostly just to try out different themes. I eventually settled on Thibaud Leprêtre’s <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/">tranquilpeak theme</a>.</p>
<p>Back to RStudio. The next step was to build the new site with the chosen theme. Here is the code I used to build the new site with this theme:</p>
<pre><code>blogdown::new_site(sample = FALSE, theme = &quot;kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme&quot;, theme_example = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to start with a clean slate so I chose not to install sample data or a theme_example. I committed the changes to Github and checked to make sure the new files were there.</p>
</div>
<div id="netlify" class="section level3">
<h3>Netlify:</h3>
<p>Connecting the new site (Github repository) to Netlify was the next step. Because I wanted to start with no sample data, the content folder was empty to begin with. I found that my initial commit did not bring over the content directory. This caused an error when I attempted to deploy the new site on Netlify. To solve this I just added a .gitkeep file in the content directory and committed that change.</p>
<pre><code>file.create(&quot;content/.gitkeep&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>At <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, I logged in with my Github account. I clicked on “New site from Git.” to get started. Here I just followed the instructions from section 3.1 Netlify in the ebook. I selected the correct repository from Github and added “hugo” as the Build Command and “public” as the Publish Directory. Finally, I clicked on Advanced settings where I was able to create a new Build Environment Variable. I created “HUGO_VERSION” with the value 0.31.1 (which I found earlier). That’s it. I deployed the new site and it was up and running.</p>
<p>Initially you get a funny-looking url but you can easily change this under Site Settings. Click Change Site Name and choose a better name. I now had a live site accessible via <sitename>.netlify.com.</p>
</div>
<div id="customer-domains" class="section level3">
<h3>Customer Domains:</h3>
<p>I decided to go with a custom domain. In Netlify, also under Site Settings is a section for Domain Management where you can set the custom domain. I followed the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/">Using a custom domain</a> documentation to set DNS settings correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="customizing-my-new-site" class="section level2">
<h2>Customizing my new site:</h2>
<p>At this point there really wasn’t much of a site. I started following the <a href="https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/blob/master/docs/user.md">User Documentation</a> for the tranquilpeak theme.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>There are many combinations of tools and methods to setup a blog site and for each of those many different ways to get it accomplished. The steps above describe how I did it. It may not be the best way but it works and that’s what is important.</p>
